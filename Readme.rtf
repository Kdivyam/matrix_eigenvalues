Various numerical methods to compute the eigenvalues of a matrix efficiently. 
Refer to the included PDF for a detailed writeup.


```coproject.py``` and ```bruteforce.py``` can run independently.
Other programs support them using modules.
```coproject.py``` runs perfectly with handling all the imaginary root conditions.
```bruteforce.py``` doesn't handle cases with imaginary roots.
